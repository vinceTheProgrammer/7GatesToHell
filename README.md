# Concept

- Each chapter is about an hour long and has some kind of theme and sub-plot. (Except Gate 1)
- Safe zones in-between every chapter.

## Chapters (Concept Summaries)
- Gate 1: Pull off a busy road to explore the location of the 7 Gates to Hell urban legend. Read a sign that explains that the 7 gates to hell are the 7 road underpasses a little further up the road and that the urban legend goes that if you pass under all 7, you'll arrive at Hell. Pass under all 7 only to be met with another busy road and a sign saying the same thing as the first sign you read. Explore a bit to find a water way that leads to the actual 1st gate to Hell.
